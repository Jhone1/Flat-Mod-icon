# Creating an issue

## Icon requests
Please create a seperate issue for each icon, or use checkboxes in your issue.

Please also add the filename of the icon.
  - For apps, you can find this information in the .desktop file of the app (in /usr/share/applications/ or ~/.local/share/applications/) under `Icon`.
  - For mimetypes, this is the mimetype itself in the properties of the file.
